## Client Brief

Hi! Thanks for agreeing to work on my website. I run a small bakery called “Sweet Delights,” and I’d love your help in creating a site that showcases my products and attracts more customers. Here’s what I’m envisioning:

### Design Elements

1. Visual Style:
    - I want the website to feel warm and inviting, with a cozy, homey vibe.
    - Color scheme: Soft pastels—think light pinks, mint greens, and cream.
        1. Soft Pink (#F8BBD0): For accents and buttons.
        2. Mint Green (#B2E1D4): For backgrounds or sections to create a fresh look.
        3. Cream (#FFF8E1): For the main background to keep it light and airy.
        4. Chocolate Brown (#4E3B31): For text and some header elements, adding a rich contrast.
        5. Peach (#FFCCB6): For highlights or hover effects.

2. Layout:
    - A clean, easy-to-navigate layout.
    - A prominent header with my bakery’s name and logo (I can send you the logo).
    - A hero image that showcases some of our best-selling pastries.

3. Sections:

    - Home: Brief intro to our bakery, highlighting our mission and values.
    - Menu: A detailed list of our offerings, with mouth-watering images.
    - About Us: Our story and the people behind Sweet Delights.
    - Contact: A simple contact form, location map, and social media links.
    - Order Online: An easy way for customers to place orders directly.

4. Functionality:
    - I’d like it to be mobile-friendly since many people browse on their phones.
    - If possible, include an Instagram feed that shows our latest creations.

### Additional Thoughts

- I’m not super tech-savvy, so it needs to be easy for me to update the menu and images.
- I’d love to include a blog section where I can share recipes or baking tips.

### Inspirations

- I’ve seen some bakery websites that I love—clean, beautiful images, and easy to read. If you could incorporate some of those ideas, that would be amazing!

### Timeline

- I’d ideally like to launch in the next month, so I hope we can work together to make this happen!
- Let me know if you need any more details, or if you have suggestions based on your expertise!
