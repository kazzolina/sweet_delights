# Sweet Delights

Author(s): Kaitlyn Azzolina

## Client Brief

Hi! Thanks for agreeing to work on my website. I run a small bakery called “Sweet Delights,” and I’d love your help in creating a site that showcases my products and attracts more customers. Here’s what I’m envisioning:

### Design Elements

1. Visual Style:
    - I want the website to feel warm and inviting, with a cozy, homey vibe.
    - Color scheme: Soft pastels—think light pinks, mint greens, and cream.
        1. Soft Pink (#F8BBD0): For accents and buttons.
        2. Mint Green (#B2E1D4): For backgrounds or sections to create a fresh look.
        3. Cream (#FFF8E1): For the main background to keep it light and airy.
        4. Chocolate Brown (#4E3B31): For text and some header elements, adding a rich contrast.
        5. Peach (#FFCCB6): For highlights or hover effects.

2. Layout:
    - A clean, easy-to-navigate layout.
    - A prominent header with my bakery’s name and logo (I can send you the logo).
    - A hero image that showcases some of our best-selling pastries.

3. Sections:

    - Home: Brief intro to our bakery, highlighting our mission and values.
    - Menu: A detailed list of our offerings, with mouth-watering images.
    - About Us: Our story and the people behind Sweet Delights.
    - Contact: A simple contact form, location map, and social media links.
    - Order Online: An easy way for customers to place orders directly.

4. Functionality:
    - I’d like it to be mobile-friendly since many people browse on their phones.
    - If possible, include an Instagram feed that shows our latest creations.

### Additional Thoughts

- I’m not super tech-savvy, so it needs to be easy for me to update the menu and images.
- I’d love to include a blog section where I can share recipes or baking tips.

### Inspirations

- I’ve seen some bakery websites that I love—clean, beautiful images, and easy to read. If you could incorporate some of those ideas, that would be amazing!

### Timeline

- I’d ideally like to launch in the next month, so I hope we can work together to make this happen!
- Let me know if you need any more details, or if you have suggestions based on your expertise!

## React app instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
